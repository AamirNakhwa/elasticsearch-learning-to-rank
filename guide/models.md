# Supported model formats

## Ranklib (deprecated)
Type: `model/ranklib`
All models generated by https://github.com/o19s/RankyMcRankFace

## Linear Model
Type: `model/linear`

Generates a simple linear ranker. The format is a simple `json` object:

```json
{
  "feature1" : 0.3,
  "feature2" : 0.5,
  "feature3" : 0.1
}
```

## XGBoost
Type: `model/xgboost+json`

Limitations:
- only numeric conditions defined in `split_condition` (categorical features are not supported `"split": "feat1=categ1"`)
- the `missing` branch is not supported and is completely ignored. (NOTE: that the plugin will use 0 for missing features).

Simple example with one tree:

```json
[
   {
      "nodeid":0,
      "split":"feature1",
      "depth":0,
      "split_condition":0.123,
      "yes":1,
      "no":2,
      "missing":2,
      "children":[
         {
            "nodeid":1,
            "depth":1,
            "leaf":0.5
         },
         {
            "nodeid":2,
            "depth":1,
            "leaf":0.2
         }
      ]
   }
]
```
